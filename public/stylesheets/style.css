  width: 60px;Time has always been essential, if words could describe time words would call it a friend to evolution and a foe to extinction. Unlike many other things that have been a fad, those famous moments for an inventor that come for a season and go in a blink of an eye, we can all agree that technology has made it impossible for video games to ever be just a memory. The gaming industry as we can see, that time has truly blessed those who love to play video games. Gaming its legendary, its the secret society of coding that started with something so simple like Space Invaders to Pac-man to Mario Bros to Sonic to now, making history in a billion dollar industry thanks to Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty and obviously our coders who are behind the scenes making this shit happen. I mean obviously, throughout the decades we can see that technology has truly advanced, some would call it a game changer others would call it innovation. There is nothing more exhilarating than watching two worlds create a new era with old school flavor gaming on a new more hi tech souped up system, right at your fingertips. No matter the time, people still have that curiosity to see where it all started and right here in this very moment is where you can see how we as gamers, coders have created history.
